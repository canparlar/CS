Given a stack of N disks arranged from largest on the bottom to smallest on top placed on a rod, together with two empty rods, write a program that finds the minimum number of moves required to move the stack from the first rod to the last one, where moves are allowed only if a smaller disk is placed on top of a larger disk.

For example, for 3 disks, the solution requires moving the disks 7 times:

Move disk from [1] to [3]
Move disk from [1] to [2]
Move disk from [3] to [2]
Move disk from [1] to [3]
Move disk from [2] to [1]
Move disk from [2] to [3]
Move disk from [1] to [3]
